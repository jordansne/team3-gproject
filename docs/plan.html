        <h1>Project Plan</h1>
        <p>(Update March 24, 2017): Due to time constraints and the essentiality to prioritize stability over the number
        of features, unfortunately we did not have time to implement either of the proposed ideas.</p>

        <p>(Update March 3, 2017): Project is on track, and proposed features below are still planned on being
        implemented.</p>

        <h3>Ingredient Suggestions</h3>

        <section class="proposal-paragraph">
            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>As the user types in their ingredients, a list of auto-complete suggestions appears. For example,
            if a user types in “chicken”, suggestions such as “chicken breast” and “chicken wings” could pop up. One of the
            websites we are taking inspiration from, supercook.com, does this; it seems to be a helpful feature that helps
            avoid typos when searching.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="proposal-paragraph">
            <h4>Implementation: </h4>
            <p>Implementing this would involve utilizing interactive JavaScript to update the suggestion list at every change to
            the search box. The suggestions list would have be retrieved from the backend, so a list of ingredient would have
            to be stored in a database for retrieve. This is feasible given extra time is available.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="proposal-paragraph">
            <h4>Dependency: </h4>
            <p>The project does not heavily rely on this feature, as it's only purpose is to improve ease-of-use for the user,
            and therefore does not affect the overall purpose of the website.</p>
        </section>

        <h3>Intelligent Search Result Ranking</h3>

        <section class="proposal-paragraph">
            <h4>Description: </h4>
            <p>Time permitting, it would be interesting to implement search result tailoring based on past user behaviour.
            Similar to how Google or YouTube present search results to users based on things they have previously searched for,
            liked, or watched, our website would return results based on the types of food the user has previously liked. For
            example, a user who has liked or saved a number of Indian recipes will see Indian recipes higher up in the search
            results the next time they perform a search.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="proposal-paragraph">
            <h4>Implementation: </h4>
            <p>Adding this feature to our project would require a heavy amount of backend work in order to generate suggestions
            for the user. This could be implemented using a heuristic analysis which looks at the tags in the list of user
            likes or favourites, and weights results accordingly. Results could be scored based on relevance and number of
            missing ingredients, and points could be added based on whether the user has liked similar recipes in the past. The
            results will then be listed based on score, with the highest scoring results appearing first. Granted this will
            require a lot of work to be effective, it is only feasible given there is enough time to implement if other aspects
            of project go smoothly.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="proposal-paragraph">
            <h4>Dependency: </h4>
            <p>While this rest of the project does not rely on this feature, it would greatly improve the satisfaction of the
            user on the site. This might help to increase the user's interest in the site.</p>
