        <h3>Team Member List</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ali Al-Tekriti</li>
            <li>Diana Boras</li>
            <li>George Orfanides</li>
            <li>Jordan Mathewson</li>

            <li>Qiang Zhou</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Diana Boras -- <span style="color: gray;">Full Stack Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Diana is a second year computer science student with experience in backend development using Java, Python and C. She
        has an interest in problem solving through challenging subjects which is why computer science is her field of choice.
        Her goal is to be an entrepreneur using the thinking skills she develops through computer science. Diana also loves to
        travel, socialize and sleep. Her role in this course is being a “floater”, helping on frontend but looking forward to
        contributing to back end as well.</p>

        <h3>Kathryn Wilkinson -- <span style="color: gray;">Front End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Kathryn is a Mechatronic Systems Engineering and Computer Science double major. She has experience working with C,
        C++, Java, and Python. She has also dabbled in web design and frontend development, so that will be her role in this
        project. Kathryn finds the things she is studying to be really, really fascinating, and while she is still undecided on
        what she wants to do when she has completed her studies at Western, she is leaning towards autonomous robotics and
        artificial intelligence. Her hobbies include video games, cooking, watching cartoons, photography, and playing bass.
        Also, she spends a lot of time thinking about dogs, food, and terrible puns.</p>

        <h3>Jordan Mathewson -- <span style="color: gray;">Front End Developer &amp; Repository Manager</span></h3>
        <p>Jordan is a passionate developer that loves working with Java &amp; JavaScript. While most of his experience lies
        in backend development, frontend &amp; full stack development have been recent interests of his. When he is not
        working on software projects on the side, he enjoys riding motorcycles, photography, and rock climbing.</p>

        <h3>Kirk Vander Ploeg -- <span style="color: gray;">Front End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>As an experienced back-end developer, Kirk has a strong command of advanced programing concepts and various
        languages. Excited to further his knowledge of front end development, Kirk is eager to apply his skills while hoping
        to gain valuable experience along the way. In his spare time, Kirk enjoys socializing with friends, playing piano, and
        watching baseball.</p>

        <h3>Nathan Fallowfield -- <span style="color: gray;">Front End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Nathan's background in computer science includes the standard computer science courses offered at Western. This
        consists of experience using Python as well as Java. He also has recreational experience using JavaScript and PHP,
        giving him a small amount of background knowledge with these languages. His role within the team for the 2212 project
        is to be a contributor to the front-end development of the web app.</p>

        <h3>Ali Al-Tekriti -- <span style="color: gray;">Back End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Ali is a second year Computer Science student at Western University. He is originally from Iraq, and has been in
        Canada for over 3 years. His hobbies include playing video games, watching Youtube videos, and skipping classes, more
        specifically, morning classes. Additionally, he has been trying to make himself go to the gym in the morning, but his
        love &amp; passion for his pillow haven’t been but a great obstacle in the face of morning activities. He has been told
        that he’s humorous (when he’s not feeling anxious).</p>

        <h3>George Orfanides -- <span style="color: gray;">Back End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Geoerge is a mathematical sciences student who is interested in data sciences and using computers to solve problems
        that are mathematical in nature. He is a warm weather enthusiast, which means that September thru June is absolute
        suffering for him. Granted he went to school in a warmer country, he would have almost certainly dropped out
        because he hates to be indoors when the sun is out. George also enjoys running and swimming and definitely wants to
        learn to surf one day (possibly in California or Australia in the future). Hopefully the skills I develop from this
        project will get me one step closer to achieving my goals.</p>

        <h3>Khalil Choudhry -- <span style="color: gray;">Back End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Khalil is a Mechatronics Engineering student pursuing a dual degree in computer science. Most of his experience is
        with C++, C and other lower level languages. He also has some Java experience from working on android applications at
        hackathons. He has taken numerous Comp Sci courses at Western and is working on the backend of the project. His hobbies
        include collecting books, board games and bike riding.</p>

        <h3>Qiang Zhou -- <span style="color: gray;">Back End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Qiang graduated from Western 3 years ago, and majored in Actuarial Science. However, since taking CS 1026 and CS
        1027 as optional courses, he has become interested in Computer Science and since then returned back campus for CS
        studies. He has experience in Java, Python, C and some basic knowledge in C++.</p>
