        <h3>Jordan Mathewson -- <span style="color: gray;">Front End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>I am passionate developer that loves working with Java &amp; JavaScript. While most of my experience lies
        in backend development, frontend &amp; full stack development have been a recent interest of mine. When I am not
        working on software projects on the side, I enjoy riding motorcycles, photography, and rock climbing.</p>

        <h3>Nathan Fallowfield -- <span style="color: gray;">Front End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>My background in computer science includes the standard computer science courses offered at Western. This consists
        of experience using Python as well as Java. I also have recreational experience using JavaScript and PHP, giving me a
        small amount of background knowledge with these languages. My role within the team for the 2212 project is to be a
        contributor to the front-end development of our web application.</p>

        <h3>George Orfanides -- <span style="color: gray;">Back End Developer</span></h3>
        <p>I am a mathematical sciences student who is interested in data sciences and using computers to solve problems that
        are mathematical in nature. I am a warm weather enthusiast, which means that September thru June is absolute suffering
        for me. However, if I went to school in a warmer country I would almost certainly have dropped out because I hate to be
        indoors when the sun is out. I enjoy running and swimming and definitely want to learn to surf one day (I see
        California or Australia in my future). Hopefully, the skills I develop from this project will get me one step closer to
        achieving my goals.</p>
